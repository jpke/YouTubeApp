# YouTube Search App

A simple [YouTube Search App](https://appetize.io/app/jnhahxte9j2wwygntg5jummhjr?device=iphone5s&scale=75&orientation=portrait&osVersion=9.3) for iOS. Built with [React-Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

## Motivation

This was a flex-week project in the full-time [Thinkful Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/full-time/).

The goal was to learn a new framework and create a project with it within one week. This was the first project I produced towards this goal. The idea was to create a simple user interface with a navigation component, and connect it to an API.

The app allows a user to query the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/), and view 10 results at a time, with the option to paginate to more results. The user can select any result to watch it's video.
